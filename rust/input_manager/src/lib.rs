//! # The Input Manager
//!
//! It provides a clean interface to an external source.
//! The [InputManager] will be the access point from which you can:
//! - query what is possible to do for currently playing [Entity] via [InputOption]
//!
//!
//! - [] Query what entities can play
//! - [] Query what intents can be emitted for one of this entity
//! - [] Choose one of these actions
//!
//! right now, if you provide an entity, you get a map of id -> Valid Intent
//! TODO
//! You will get a map of id -> (ActionKind, parameters)
//! for instance 0 -> Movement, list of positions
//! TODO
